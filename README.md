#null vs blank
The short version is this: If a variable simply doesn’t exist — usually because it hasn’t been declared, but sometimes because it hasn’t been assigned a value — it’s null. If the variable exists but contains no data, it’s empty. And if a structured data variable, such as an array, exists but doesn’t contain any items, it’s zero-length.
If you ask me, “How big is your swimming pool?,” I can’t answer that question; I don’t have a swimming pool. Never have, probably never will.
I can’t say a nonexistent swimming pool has zero size. I can’t say it’s infinite or infinitesimal, either. The largest and smallest possible measures are still measures, and you can’t quantify things that don’t exist.
null DOESN'T MEAN 0 or ''. NULL MEANS NOTHING. IT DOESN'T MEAN EMPTY.
